# Java_OOPS_Concepts


OOPS concept

1) Class
2) Object
3) Inheritance
4) Abstraction
5) Encapsulation

1) Class : Class is the user defined data structure. Class is the blue-print

2) Object : Object is the user defined data type. Object is the instance of class.
To create a object we used following syntax

Class_name obj_name = new Class_name();
where new is the keyword  and Class_name() is the constructor of class.

3) Inheritance : Inheritance is the process of aquaring the properties of parent class to child class.
Child/Derived Class : If the class which aquare the properties, it is called as Derived class or child class.
Parent/Base Class :Aquaring the properties from any class that class is known as Parent Class or Base Class.

to aquare the property from on class to another class we used extends keyword

public Class Parent(){

}
public Class Child extends Parent()
{
// this class will aquare the property from parent class so we used extends keyword
}

Types of Inheritance :
 There are 4 types of inheritance in java 
 
1)Single inheritance
2)MultiLevel Inheritance
3)Multiple Inheritance: it does not support directly we need to used interface
4)Hybrid Inheritance
